# Terrain Viewer
This is a university assignment for Advanced Computer Graphics. The task was to implement a height-map based terrain viewer which implemented dynamic level-of-detail via tesselation shaders. I chose to complete my assignment in the Rust programming language instead of C++ (for which we had sample code provided)

## Controls
**Arrow keys** to move the camera.
**I** and **O** to change the Ash level.
**K** and **L** to change the Lava level.
**P** to toggle wireframe mode.
**H** to toggle between the two heightmaps.
